# CHURN-ANALYSIS-PROJECT
                     Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This dataset provides detailed customer-level data from a telecom service provider, including demographics, account information, service usage, and whether a customer has churned. It's an ideal foundation for churn prediction modeling, customer segmentation, and business strategy optimization.

Churn Is Not Random
     Churned customers often share common traits—such as having monthly contracts, no internet              services, or low tenure—making them easier to target with retention efforts.

Contract Type Makes or Breaks Loyalty
     Customers with month-to-month contracts are far more likely to churn than those with 1- or 2-         year contracts. Long-term plans significantly boost customer stickiness.

Tenure Tells a Story
     The probability of churn drops sharply after the first few months. This “danger zone” at the          beginning of the customer lifecycle is critical for engagement and onboarding strategies.

Internet & Tech Support Gaps Are Red Flags
     Lack of technical support, online security, or backup services correlates with higher churn.          Offering these as bundled packages could improve retention.     

Paperless Billing and Churn Go Hand-in-Hand
     Interestingly, customers using paperless billing show a slightly higher churn rate—possibly           indicating tech-savvy users who are more price-sensitive and open to switching.

Customer churn is one of the biggest threats to subscription-based businesses.
